### Katana - Be Free and Be Efficient!

Katana is fork of KDE Software Distribution with emphasis on efficiency. So far
it has proven to be roughly 50% less system resource hungry and significantly
faster.

### Authors and Contributors

Since Katana is a fork of someone else's work, many of the credits go to the KDE
Software Development team. So far there are not much people involved in this
project but we hope that the number will increase.

Software can always be improved, and the Katana team is ready to do so.
However, you - the user - must tell us when something does not work as
expected or could be done better. You do not have to be a software developer
to be a member of the Katana team. You can join the national teams that
translate program interfaces. You can provide graphics, themes, sounds, and
improved documentation. You decide!
