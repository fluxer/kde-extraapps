 * HISTORY: this was a base class for Catalog import plugins in KBabel,
 * but this architecture isn't not suitable for XML-based files
 * (when whole DOM-tree is stored in memory to prevent file clashes)
  *
 * This class is the base for import plugins for catalogs.
 * It provides "transactional behavior", so the changes are stored in 
 * catalog only if the import process finishes successfully. 
 *
 * To use it, just subclass and redefine load() and id() methods.
 * When importing, you can use the protected methods for setting
 * the catalog. New catalog items can be added using appendCatalogItem.
