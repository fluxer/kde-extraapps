Quassel IRC - Release Notes
===========================

Please find the current release notes at <http://quassel-irc.org>.

On first run of the Quassel core, it will wait for a client to connect
and present a first-run wizard that will allow you to create the database
and one admin user for the core-side storage.

To add more users, run: `quasselcore --add-user`
To change the password of an existing user: `quasselcore --change-userpass=username`
The manageusers.py script is deprecated.

IRC is the preferred means of getting in touch with the developers.
The Quassel IRC Team can be contacted on Freenode/#quassel (or
#quassel.de).  We always welcome new users in our channels!
