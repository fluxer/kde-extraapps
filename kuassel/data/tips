<p>When you join a channel and see folks with the @ in front of their nickname,
this means that they are an Op, or Operator of the channel.</p>

<p>If you spend anytime on IRC at all, you'll begin to notice letters strung
together and not making any sense. As folks spend more time typing, they find
ways to shortcut certain phrases, or sentences.</p>

<p>There are certain rules of etiquette for chatting on IRC, usually called
'Netiquette', and if you'll follow a few rules of common courtesy, you'll find
your stay quite enjoyable. <strong>TYPING IN ALL CAPS</strong> is usually viewed as shouting,
and not recommended if you wish to continue to participate in a channel. Using
foul language, or being rude to others is also discouraged on most channels. If
you join a channel and find it offensive, simply leave, there are thousands of
others to choose from.</p>

<p>Chatting isn't the only thing we can do while using IRC. Folks can PLAY sounds
that are in their computers already, or can GET sounds from someone else by
requesting them. To play a sound, the command is <em>/sound wavename.wav</em>. There are
literally thousands of wavs available, which is the term used to describe a
sound file. Not all channels allow wavs to be played, so just hang out, or ask
one of the ops what their policy is on the playing of wavs.</p>
