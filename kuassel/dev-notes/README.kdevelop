The Quassel.kdevelop file is a copy of my project file for Quassel. You can use this
as a starting point for your KDevelop project after doing the following:

1) Copy the file into quassel's root directory
2) Search/Replace all occurrences of PROJECT_ROOT with the absolute path of that directory

Unfortunately, KDevelop does not allow relative paths...
