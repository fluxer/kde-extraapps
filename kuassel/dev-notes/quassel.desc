Quassel IRC is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client, meaning that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central core -- much like the popular combination of screen + irssi, but using a GUI. Re-attaching a client will show your IRC session in the same state as you left it in (plus whatever happened while you were gone), and this even if you re-attach from a different location. QuasselTopia is the Qtopia-based, mobile edition of the Quassel Client that allows you to connect to a Quassel Core from your cell phone or PDA, thus giving you a rich IRC experience while still being lightweight.
