Version 2.1+

_Certainly_:
*external subtitle support
*'o' in fullscreen mode shows OSD of length and elapsed time info, <-- emulate mplayer
*indiciate remote media somehow in PlayDialog
*resume DVD playback, probably requires remembering chapter and stuff which might need more Phonon API
*Look into using LiveConnectExtension to provide a WMP or RealPlayer-like JavaScript interface for the kpart. KMplayer apparently does this.

_Thoughts_:
*a movie-like rolling credits instead of the about dialog
*PlayDialog optimization
    *allow filtering by audio/video? too confusing?
*Chapter skipping (done, more testing needed)
*More feedback at playback end (done?)
    ->Playback finished message (amaroK statusbar code?)
    ->play next file button - be smart enough to know that 100 > 20
*refactor: get rid of Engine::Status, just use Phonon's status
*use libkcddb, have the videoWindow display list of tracks in audio cd and highlight currently playing song. Have a button for the "edit cd" libkcddb dialog.
    ->something similar for pls/m3u files? people would probably want to edit the playlist then...
*a super-awesome open file dialog or integrated widget
    **it would indicate which files you've already watched, and for how long
    **use dolphin-part? or from scratch. or creating a new view to a DirModel. or extending somthing else.

_Probably Not_:
*live previews of previously played videos


Before 2.0-rc1:
*Audio channel selection (done?)
*test the PLS code
*audio channel and subtitles...
	*record their setting for between sessions (done?)
        *does audio need an "auto" or is that the same as the first option? (not same, still confusing)
                  the deal is that "auto" for both subtitle and audio channel means what is picked by the user in the DVD menu
                  If the user picks something in the DVD menu, this does not change what xine says the subtitle or audio
                  channel is. This sucks!
*test VCDs, audio CDs -> add Solid magic, test with two drives (done, more testing needed)
*turn off screensaver when something is playing (done? testing needed)
