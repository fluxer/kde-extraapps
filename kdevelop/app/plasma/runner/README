KDevelop Session Runner
========================
This Runner loads a list of KDevelop's sessions and matches
KRunner's queries against it.

The matching goes as follows:

* You type "kdevelop" into the krunner interface, this KDevelop
  Session Runner adds all kdevelop sessions, with a low priority.
  (0.5)

* You type "kdevelop gnirrep" and the runner will find a session
  called "gnirrep", priority 1.0

* Typing just a part, such as "kdevelop gnirr" also results in a
  match, but lower priority (0.8)

* Typing just the (parts of) the name of the session will
  also match (the "kdevelop" in the query is optional).

All matching is case-insensitive.

Happy hacking!
