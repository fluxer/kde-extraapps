You should *not* touch this code, besides rebasing it against an official
Astyle release.

When you find a bug, fix it upstream, see e.g. http://astyle.sourceforge.net/subversion.html

When you still have to touch this code, please mark your changes explicitly,
for example this would be good:

  ...
  //BEGIN KDEVELOP
  // see also: {link to reviewboard or bug}
  ... your changes here
  //END KDEVELOP
  ...

This makes it easier to rebase them afterwards onto a new AStyle release.

Also make sure you add a unit test!
