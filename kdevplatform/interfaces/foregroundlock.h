/**
 * A locking object that locks the resources that are associated to the main thread. When this lock is held,
 * you can call any thread-unsafe functions, because the foreground thread is locked in an event.
 *
 * The lock always becomes available when the foreground thread stops processing events.
 *
 * @warning There is one simple rule you must always follow to prevent deadlocks:
 *                  @em Never lock anything before locking the foreground mutex!!
 *                   That also means that you must not take this lock in contexts where
 *                   you don't know what other mutexes might be locked. 
 *
 * @warning Objects that have QObject as base always get the thread they were created in assigned (see thread affinity, QObject::moveToThread),
 *                  which seriously affects the objects functionality regarding signals/slots.
 *                 The foreground lock does not change the thread affinity, so holding the foreground lock does not fully equal being in the foreground.
 *                 It may generally be unsafe to call foreground functions that create QObjects from within the background.
