/**
 * @short Implements a context menu extension in an editor context which provides
 *  an action that allows switching to associated buddy documents.
 *
 * Using the @c IBuddyDocumentFinder interface, the current document's
 * language plugin provides potential buddy candidates. Depending on their
 * existence on the file system the @c SwitchToBuddyPlugin
 * enables a 'Switch To XXX' action which opens that buddy document
 * using the @c IDocumentController.
 *
 * If a language plugin either doens't provide the @c IBuddyDocumentFinder
 * interface or no buddy exists on the file system, no context menu
 * extension is performed.
