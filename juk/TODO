Just a quick 3.4 checklist.  I'll add things as they pop into my mind...

( ) Make the upcoming playlist not suck, specifically I'd like to see it as a
    real and usable replacement for the "Play Next" feature, which it
    presently is not.

( ) At least play with making the "Now Playing" bar resizable.  Currently have
    something sort of working putting it in a slider type of thing.  Not sure
    if I like it.

( ) Fix the cover manager in lots of ways.  I really don't like having the icon
    in the listview and have played around with a few things to fix this.  What
    I'm currently thinking is making a "cover manager" as a view mode and when
    the user clicks to set the cover switching to that mode.  Or something like
    that.  Something's got to give.

( ) Show a preview of the cover to be added before saving it.
