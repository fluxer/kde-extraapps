This is a basic plasmoid to notify you about
new messages from any service you have running.
This is particularly useful and designed for locked
screen with the plasma-overlay so you don't have to
unlock just to check if you got new messages (mail,im,
any other service, ...).
It uses DBus and only adds information for apps that are
running (it checks for the dbus interface). At the moment
sadly only kmail notifies over DBus for new messages.
Also qutIM notifies about count of unreaded messages.
Hack on it as you like.
