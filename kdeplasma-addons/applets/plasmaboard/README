Welcome to plasmaboard, a virtual keyboard for your desktop! It is designed especially with touchscreen users in mind. You can use it with KDE 4.4 and above

REQUIREMENTS:
- You need a working GNU Compiler toolchain. 
- Cmake
- KDE Headers files (kde development packages)
- Xlib Header files (X develpment packages)
- XTest Extension Header files (X develpment packages)
- QT Header files (QT development packages)


HOW TO INSTALL

In the main directory run 
 - cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix`
 - make
 - make install/strip (as root or: sudo make install/strip )
 

KNOWN ISSUES

- Plasmaboard does only (!) work when you place it in the panel. You can place it on the desktop but clicking on its buttons will do nothing

- When pressing "Alt Gr" the symbols on the keyboard do not adapt. This is an issue with the underlying X-Function, which seems
only to do mapping for the shift key correctly. No known solution yet. Despite of that AltGr works as expected 

- When changing the xkb-modmap, plasmaboard does not adapt automatically. You need to force the relabeling of the keys. Press "Shift" for example

- Backspace key does not work in eclipse. Don't know why. If you find other applications in which plasmaboard doesn't work as expected, please report
