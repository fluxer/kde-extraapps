TODO FOR 4.1:

- clean the code: class Picture is added (28th January 2008), still to do is add slideshow code there
- comic-like engine to support many Pictures of The Day => in playground/base/plasma/engines/potd (started 1st February 2008)

- clean the config dialog and take ideas from Desktop config (share some config settings?) - add recursive dirs as an option for slideshow (although beware of too many options)

- right-click action: set as wallpaper for the current picture

------------------
Ideas about Wikimedia Commons Featured Pictures
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Featured_pictures
- get them as wallpapers
- make a package of them and set them as slideshow for screensaver or desktop slideshow
-> credits?
Any questions can be asked to Duesentrieb in #wikimedia-tools on IRC freenode and #wikimedia-tech for anything related to website access. Mailing lists: http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Mailing_lists/overview

IDEAS FOR THE FRAME APPLET

- export the pic to Flickr
- display the album cover if the user is playing some music
- from leinir: http://farm1.static.flickr.com/135/328898823_ae9eb3dfd6_m.jpg 
The images sort of scale down and fade in when the appear... then after thirty or so pictures are shown, the lower ones fade out again :)
- meta data: flip the pic and read metadata (date, size,...) and add your own comment
