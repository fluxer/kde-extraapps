Todo:

* Limitations:
  - Doesn't notify the user that the wallpaper needs to be configured before
    working, maybe not that big of a problem, though
  - Changing to a new location and then back to an old one doesn't work


* Features:
  - Add an element of time in determining the wallpaper, so that night pics can
    come at night, etc. (The weather icon we receive can't provide this for most 
    weathers)
  - Show basic weather info/location name on top left of screen
    + Autodetect metric/imperial measurement systems based on locale, or at least
      let the user choose between the two
  - Allow the user to set a custom wallpaper for weather conditions.
    + Use m_weatherMap to store wallpaper/weather assignments
    + Implement advanced settings dialog to house the feature
