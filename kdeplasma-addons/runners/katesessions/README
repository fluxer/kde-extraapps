Kate Session Runner
========================
This Runner loads a list of Kate's sessions and matches
KRunner's queries against it.

The matching goes as follows:

* You type "kate" into the krunner interface, this Kate
  Session Runner adds all kate sessions, with a low priority.
  (0.5)

* You type "kate gnirrep" and the runner will find a session
  called "gnirrep", priority 1.0

* Typing just a part, such as "kate gnirr" also results in a
  match, but lower priority (0.8)

* Typing just the (parts of) the name of the session will
  also match (the "kate" in the query is optional).

All matching is case-insensitive.

Happy hacking!
